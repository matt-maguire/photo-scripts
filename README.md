# photo-scripts

This repository contains some scripts used to manage photo files on my mac. They are based on the scripts described
in Keifer Hunniford's youTube video:

The scripts were designed for linux, and so require some adaptations to work on Mac. Also, I'm still working out
how to cut the cord with Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop, and so the scripts will probably evolve anyway as I fine-tune
my new workflows.
